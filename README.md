## Exclusive Features

### Auto Rename & Smart Metadata Extraction

Auto rename is a template-driven renaming system that extracts structured metadata directly from filenames before upload. It reads the title, season, episode, chapter, quality, and audio track from the raw filename and renames the file according to a pattern you define. It can be toggled on or off per user from the user settings panel (`/usetting`).

When auto rename is active, every file passing through the bot — whether from a direct link, torrent, Telegram file, or extracted archive — is renamed automatically before it hits the upload pipeline. No manual intervention needed.

<details>
  <summary><b>Template Tags</b></summary>

| Tag | What It Extracts |
|---|---|
| `{title}` | The show or file title, cleaned of noise like quality tags, group names, and codec strings |
| `{season}` | Season number (e.g. `01`, `02`) |
| `{episode}` | Episode number (e.g. `05`, `12`) |
| `{chapter}` | Chapter number, zero-padded to 3 digits (e.g. `001`, `045`, `140`) |
| `{quality}` | Video quality string (e.g. `1080p`, `720p`, `HDRip`) |
| `{audio}` | Audio language or type tag — used in captions to indicate dub, sub, or multi-audio |

Template examples:

```
{title} - S{season}E{episode} [{quality}]
{title} S{season}E{episode} {audio}
{title} - Chapter {chapter}.pdf
[{chapter}] {title}.pdf
Ch-{chapter} - {title}.pdf
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Title Extraction & Quality Auto-Detection</b></summary>

The extractor strips known noise from the filename — quality markers, resolution strings, codec identifiers, release group tags, site watermarks — and returns the clean content title. It handles anime, manga, manhwa, live-action, and generic files consistently.

```
[S01-E03] Takamine San [1080p][x264]        →  Takamine San
[CH-140] Infinite Mage - AnimeDynasty.pdf   →  Infinite Mage
Attack.on.Titan.S04E28.1080p.WEB.mkv        →  Attack on Titan
[SubsPlease] Frieren - 16 (1080p).mkv       →  Frieren
```

If `{quality}` is in the template but no quality string is detected, the extractor falls back to a file-size check. Any file over **500 MB** without a detected quality tag automatically receives `HDRip` as the quality value.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Chapter Detection</b></summary>

Chapters are zero-padded to 3 digits. The extractor recognises a wide range of release naming conventions including Japanese numerals:

```
[CH-140] Blue Lock.pdf            →  140
[CH 58] One Piece.pdf             →  058
[059] Solo Leveling.pdf           →  059
Ch-123 My Hero Academia.pdf       →  123
[C576] Lookism @Manga_Cruise.pdf  →  576
#88 Naruto.pdf                    →  088
Ep-19 Demon Slayer.pdf            →  019

S01E13 Classroom of the Elite     →  013
364 END Berserk.pdf               →  364
456 Final Tokyo Ghoul.pdf         →  456
c 789 Black Clover.pdf            →  789
Ch1234 One Punch Man.pdf          →  1234
C 25 Hunter x Hunter.pdf          →  025
Episode 12 Chainsaw Man.pdf       →  012
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Regex Rename (Legacy)</b></summary>

The older find-and-replace rename system based on regex patterns continues to work alongside the template system. Configure a regex pattern and a replacement string separately in `/usetting`. Both coexist — regex rename runs first on the raw filename, and then the template is applied to the result if auto rename is enabled.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Batch Torrents & Archive Extraction</b></summary>

When a torrent contains multiple files, auto rename processes each file independently. Metadata is extracted per file, not per torrent — so a batch release with 12 episodes or 20 chapters will have every individual file renamed based on its own filename.

Auto rename also runs as a post-extraction step. When a ZIP, RAR, 7z, or split archive is extracted, every resulting file is passed through the full rename pipeline before upload.

</details>

---

### Per-Task Manual Filename Override (`-n`)

The `-n` flag lets you force a specific output filename for any single task, bypassing auto rename entirely. No metadata extraction, no template substitution, no regex processing — it is a hard per-task override.

<details>
  <summary><b>Usage Examples</b></summary>

Inline with a URL:
```
/command https://example.com/file.mkv -n Filename.mkv
```

By replying to a file:
```
/command -n Filename.mkv
```

With direct links:
```
/command https://files.example.com/release.zip -n ShowName.S01E04.1080p.mkv
/command https://cdn.example.org/manga-ch140.pdf -n [CH-140] Blue Lock.pdf
```

With torrents (single-file sets filename, multi-file sets root folder name):
```
/command magnet:?xt=urn:btih:HASH&dn=... -n ShowName.S02E05.mkv
/command -n ShowName.S02E05.mkv
```

With Telegram files (reply to any document, video, or audio):
```
/command -n CleanName.mp4
/command -n [CH-140] Blue Lock.pdf
```

</details>

---

### Custom Leech Thumbnail (`/t`)

Each user can set a persistent custom thumbnail applied to every file they leech. Stored per-user in the database — works across sessions without re-setting.

<details>
  <summary><b>Usage</b></summary>

Reply to any photo in Telegram with either command:
```
/t
/thumbnail
```

Both are identical. The photo you replied to is saved as your thumbnail. To clear or change it, go to `/usetting` → Thumbnail.

Once set, the thumbnail is applied to all leeched output — videos, documents, audio files, and every part of a split upload.

</details>

---

### Intro Subtitles

Intro subtitles let you burn a text overlay into the opening seconds of a video during the leech process, before the file is sent to Telegram. The overlay is rendered via FFmpeg and embedded directly into the video stream — not as a separate subtitle track.

<details>
  <summary><b>Details</b></summary>

- Appears for a configured duration at the start of the video, then disappears
- Useful for adding a channel name, group tag, or attribution watermark as a brief bumper
- Configuration — text content, display duration in seconds, font size, position, and styling — is managed through `/usetting`
- Does not re-encode the entire file; only the intro segment is processed

</details>

---

### GDrive Clean (`/gdclean`, `/gc`)

Owner-only command to bulk delete or trash all files inside a Google Drive folder.

<details>
  <summary><b>Details</b></summary>

- Accepts a Drive folder link inline or as a reply
- Defaults to the configured `GDRIVE_ID` if no link provided
- Shows folder name, size, file count, and folder count before acting
- Two options: **Move to Bin** (restorable) or **Permanent Clean** (irreversible)
- Folder itself is never deleted — only the files inside
- Confirmation buttons prevent accidental execution

</details>

---

### Personal Bot & Personal Dump

<details>
  <summary><b>Personal Bot</b></summary>

- Each user can connect their own Telegram bot token via `/usetting` → Personal Bot
- Leeched files are sent through the user's personal bot instead of the main bot
- Provides isolation — files appear from a different bot identity
- Verification step ensures the token and bot are valid before saving

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Personal Dump</b></summary>

- Each user can configure a personal channel or group as their dump destination via `/usetting` → Personal Dump
- All leeched files go to the dump channel/group automatically
- Supports channel IDs and usernames
- Verification checks that the bot (or user bot) has send permissions in the target

</details>

---

## Deployment

<details>
  <summary><b>Docker Compose (Recommended)</b></summary>

### 1. Install Docker & Docker Compose
Install Docker, Docker Compose plugin, and `nano` editor on Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose-v2 nano
```

### 2. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aquib4040/AZML.git
cd AZML
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables (`.env`)
Create and edit your `.env` file using `nano`. Docker Compose will automatically detect and load this `.env` file upon container startup:

```bash
nano .env
```

Paste your required configuration variables (e.g. `BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_API`, `TELEGRAM_HASH`, `OWNER_ID`, `DATABASE_URL`):

```env
BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyZ
OWNER_ID=123456789
TELEGRAM_API=123456
TELEGRAM_HASH=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://...
```
*(Press `Ctrl+O` then `Enter` to save, and `Ctrl+X` to exit nano.)*

### 4. Build and Run Container
Start the bot in detached (background) mode:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### 5. Container Management Commands
- **View Live Logs**:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs -f
  ```
- **Restart Bot**:
  ```bash
  docker compose restart
  ```
- **Stop Bot**:
  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```
- **Update & Rebuild**:
  ```bash
  git pull && docker compose up -d --build
  ```
